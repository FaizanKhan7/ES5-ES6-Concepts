            <h2>
                Difference between <span>var</span> <span>const</span> &
                <span>let</span>
            </h2>
            <p>
                <span>var is function scoped</span> and if we try to use a variable declared with <span>var</span> before the actual declaration, we'll get <span>undefinied</span> & if we try to reference a variable which is neither declared nor defined.
                When we try to reference such variable then the result will be <span>not defined</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Const & let are blocked scoped</span> and if we try to use a variable declared with <span>let</span> or <span>const</span> before the declaration, it will throw a reference error.
                <p>Hence, variables declared with <span>let</span> can be re-assigned, but variables declared with <span>const</span> cannot be reassigned.</p>

            <h2>
                Difference between <span>function scope</span> &
                <span>block scope</span>
            </h2>
            <p>In <span>function scope</span>, the variables and functions defined inside a function block are not accessible outside its block.</p>
            <p>Variables declared with the var keyword cannot have <span>Block Scope</span>. A <span>block scope</span> is the area within <span>if statements</span>, <span>switch conditions</span> or <span>for & while loops</span>. Whenever we see {curly
                brackets}, it is a block. In <span>ES6</span>, <span>const and let</span> keywords allow us to declare variables in the <span>block scope</span>, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.</p>

                Difference between ES5 <span>function</span> & ES6
                <span>Arrow function</span>
            </h2>
            <p>Basically, a JavaScript <span>function</span> is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript <span>function</span> is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</p>
            <p>An <span>arrow function</span> expression is a alternative to a regular <span>function expression</span>.</p>
            <p>The only difference between a regular <span>function</span> & <span>arrow function</span> is that, we don't use function keyword for <span>arrow function</span> & before we return the expression we add fat arrow <span>=></span>.</p>

            <h1><span>Spread Operator</span> & <span>Rest Parameters</span></h1>
            <p>It was introduced in <span>ES6</span>, which makes it easy to <span>merge</span> arrays and objects. The <span>spread operator</span> takes an array (or any iterable) and spreads it values.</p>
            <p>The <span>rest parameter</span> syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="concepts">
            <h1><span>Destructuring</span></h1>
            <p>The <span>destructuring assignment</span> syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to <span>unpack values</span> from <span>arrays</span>, or <span>properties from objects</span>, into distinct <span>variables</span>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="concepts">
            <h1><span>higher order array methods</span></h1>
            <p>The <span>higher order array methods</span> are the powerful <span>methods</span> in JavaScript & these higher order array methods take in the <span>function</span> as a <span>parameter</span> and that callback function can take in multiple
                parameters. We can also <span>chain</span> on to other array methods. Their <span>functional programming</span> is very powerful & we can manipulate data however we want & its pretty crazy stuff.</p>
            <p>Some of the important one's are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>forEach()</span> - it just loops through an array.</li>
                <li><span>map()</span> - it allows us to create a new array from an array.</li>
                <li><span>filter()</span> - it will allow is to create a new array based on a condition.</li>
                <li><span>reduce()</span> - it executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in single output value.</li>
                <li><span>sort()</span> - it sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.</li>
            </ul>
